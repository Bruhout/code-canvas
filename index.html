                <h1>Drawing Triangles: Barycentric Coordinate, Conditional, and Scanline Algorithms</h1>

                <p>
                    You might be aware that the beautiful worlds that you see in your favourite video games, or the character in your favourite animated movies, are all made by drawing lots of little triangles to the screen. This blog discusses three different algorithms to draw triangles to the screen.

                <h1>Texture Sampling</h1>

                <p>
                    Images are applied on top of 3D geomtry in order to simulate object details without significant processing cost. This image is called the texture and this process is called texture sampling. In this blog post, we will explore exactly how the math behind the techinique works to give us the worlds we see in our beloved video games.

                <h1>Linear Interpolation in Computer Graphics</h1>

                <p>
                    Linear interpolation is a very commonly used process all across maths, and even more common in computer graphics. Linear interpolation helps us draw bezier curves, and linear interpolation is the cornerstone of any raster based 3D engine. In this blog post, we well be checking out the technique and the way it is used by a graphics engine to apparntly create data out of thin air.

            Hi! My name is Ishaan Gupta and I'm an engineering student just starting university.
            I created this blog out of my interest in computer graphics and computer generated imagery
            and I just wanted to share some of the intersting stuff I learned through my time.<br>
            The blog is incoherent in what it's about because you will find anything from mathematics to
            theoretical computer science or literally antything else in STEM, but stay tuned !
